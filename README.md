# Psycho-Crab
A dumb Unity game about climbing things as a crab. WIP, will be Early Access March 29th (assuming everything goes according to plan).

Compiled game download at https://drive.google.com/file/d/168C4QSTiiTH6EyMF3SJoSFwDa3bS3K5q/view?usp=sharing

The Steam version, if you want to support me, is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1923650/Psycho_Crab/
The game is out!

Note: SFX are from https://www.zapsplat.com and thus not legally redistributable, so the source lacks them.
I created the music however, so it's included.
