The Steam version, if you want to support me, is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1923650/Psycho_Crab/
The store page is up! Will be purchasable March 29th.

Note: SFX are from https://www.zapsplat.com and thus not legally redistributable (cuz I'm too cheap to pay for Gold.), so the source lacks them.
I created the music however, so it's included.
